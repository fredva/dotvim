# Call For Maintainers

This plugin, along with others like it, is now maintained by the
[HashiVim](http://hashivim.github.io/) organization, which is looking for
additional maintainers and contributors. See the HashiVim home page for
further information.

# vim-terraform

This plugin adds a `:Terraform` command that runs terraform, with tab completion
of subcommands. It also sets up `*.tf`, `*.tfvars`, and `*.tfstate` files to be
highlighted as HCL, HCL, and JSON respectively.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/hashivim/vim-terraform.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
